            <h1 class="blog-post-title"><em>"Sit Up: L'Alça"</em>, my lastest product demonstration:</h1>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 17, 2016 by <a href="about.html">Martí</a></p>
            
            <p>Last couple of weeks, I've been working in a project that I'm very exited about.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>"Sit Up: L'Alça" is a project that was started 10 years ago by Marta Prat. It is a solution to the bad design of the primary school's chairs. I was the one in charge of the commercial video, where the product was described and animated.</p>
            <br>
            <h2> My contribution: </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I had to model the product, given a collection of pictures of an actual prototype. This was an arduous task, because I had to guess the measures and it's always difficult to make it look proportional.</p>
            <img class="imatge" src="/imatges/alca/model.png"><br>
              3D model of the product
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> Once the model was finished, I gave it a rough plastic material, to make it look like the prototype. The node tree for the material is quite simple, I had to apply a bit ofdisplacement to add realism, as otherwise it would look too flat.</p>
            <img class="imatge" src="/imatges/alca/nodetree.png"><br>
              Node tree of the basic red plastic material
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> After that, I just had to animate the model. The rigging was not needed because there was no deformation nor complex movements. The animation was done in about 4 hours. I had to model a dummy and a chair in order to illustrate the product's features. Rendering the animation took about 3 days, that were converted to 6 hours thanks to <a href="https://www.sheepit-renderfarm.com/">Sheep-It renderfarm</a> and a friend of mine that has a powerful GPU.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Final version:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p> After a few corrections made by Marta, the video was done. The day after, the project was presented in front of institutions and bussiness. Here you can see the final version:</p>
            <br>
              <div style="overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;max-height:auto;"><div id="youtube_canvas" style="max-width:100%"><iframe style="height:393px;width:100%;max-width:100%;border:0;" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHP1BTfcWUg?hl=en&amp;autoplay=0&amp;cc_load_policy=0&amp;loop=0&amp;iv_load_policy=0&amp;fs=1&amp;showinfo=0"></iframe></div><style>#youtube_canvas img{max-width:none!important;background:none!important}</style></div>
            <br>
            <h3>Additional work:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>I posted a new image in the <a href="/html/cg.html">gallery</a>, that was also an old model, but I resylized a bit to make it look better. I changed the navbar to make it look better in mobile browsers and I also added a <a href="/html/about.html">contact info</a> section in the <em>about me</em> page.</p>

            <h1 class="blog-post-title">A window opens</h1>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">October 2, 2016 by <a href="about.html">Martí</a></p>

            <p>First entry in my blog. I'm starting a personal web page with a lot of enthusiasm.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>For 3 weeks I've been working in this web page. Finally I'm publishing the initial version, with still a lot of things to add, but I had to do it in order to push myself. During next week or so I'll be adding more and more content that now is waiting in my computer. All this content has to reach the exterior world.</p>
            <br>
            <h2> Why? </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I'm doing this to have a place where I can publish all my work, where the others can get to know me and my interests. This is a window for you to my world as well as a window for me to other people. I'm hoping that with this web page I'll be able to work more efficiently, to improve my ability to work constantly.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Initial content:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In this first version I'm publishing a lot of <a href="cg.html">old renders</a>, they need a description that I'll add later. I'm publishing <a href="physics.html">two projects </a> involving science and coding. I think i'll have to improve the information of both projects in order to give a much more in depth description. The <a href="../index.html">front page</a> is finished, but the <a href="about.html">about me</a> page needs more touches.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Further work:</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>My next objective is adding other content in the <a href="coding.html">coding</a> page because I have a lot of finished miniprojects waiting to be published. I'll add a "Traffic Jam" big project and this is what I'm working on now a days. Adding a description for each render in the <a href="cg.html">computer graphics</a> page is also a must.</p>
            <hr>
            That's all for now, here ends my first entry and here is where the funny part begins.
